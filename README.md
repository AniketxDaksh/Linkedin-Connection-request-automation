# Step-by-step guide to use LinkedIn Connection Automation:

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x installed on your machine
* Google Chrome browser installed
* Download the appropriate version of ChromeDriver based on your Chrome browser version
* A LinkedIn account
## Setup

 Install Selenium library if you haven't already:

```bash
  pip install selenium

```
Replace the driver_path variable in the code with the path to the downloaded ChromeDriver executable:

```bash 
driver_path = '/path/to/your/chromedriver'
```

Replace the sample email and password in the code with your LinkedIn credentials:

```bash 
username.send_keys('your_email@example.com')
password.send_keys('your_password')
```

Optional) Customize the note_text variable in the code with the message you would like to send in your connection requests.


## Running the script
1. Save the code as a Python file, for example, linkedin_connection_automation.py.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved.

3. Run the script using the following command:

```bash 
python linkedin_connection_automation.py
```

The script will open a Chrome browser, log into your LinkedIn account, and navigate to the search results page for people with "Power BI" in their profiles.

It will then find all "Connect" buttons on the page and send connection requests with personalized messages.

Please note that the script may need adjustments depending on changes in LinkedIn's layout, and excessive use of the script may lead to account restrictions. Use the script responsibly and adhere to LinkedIn's usage policies.
